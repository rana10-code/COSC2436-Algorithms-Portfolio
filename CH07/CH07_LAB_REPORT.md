## Algorithm Analysis

### Binary Search Tree
- **Search Time (balanced):** O(log n)
- **Search Time (unbalanced):** O(n)
- **BST Property:** A binary search tree maintains the property that for each node, all elements in the left subtree are less, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.

### Traversals

| Traversal | Order          | Use Case         |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Preorder  | Root, Left, Right | Copying a tree   |
| Inorder   | Left, Root, Right | Getting sorted elements |
| Postorder | Left, Right, Root | Deleting a tree  |

## Reflection Questions

1. **Why does inorder traversal give sorted output?**
   - Inorder traversal visits nodes in ascending order for a binary search tree, as it processes the left subtree, then the node, and finally the right subtree.

2. **When would a BST become unbalanced?**
   - A BST becomes unbalanced when nodes are inserted in a sorted order, leading to a linear structure similar to a linked list.

3. **What's the difference between BFS and DFS for trees?**
   - BFS explores nodes level by level using a queue, while DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, typically using recursion or a stack.

## Output

### [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
### True
### False
