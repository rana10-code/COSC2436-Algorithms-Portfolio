# =============================================================================
# Dijkstra's Shortest Path — Interactive CLI
#
# This program lets the user build an undirected weighted graph by entering
# nodes and edges, displays the graph as ASCII art, then finds and highlights
# the shortest path between two chosen nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
#
# Flow:
#   1. User enters node names
#   2. User enters edge weights for each pair of nodes
#   3. Graph is displayed
#   4. User picks a source and destination node
#   5. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path
#   6. Graph is re-displayed with the shortest path highlighted
# =============================================================================

    Duplicate names are rejected so every node is unique.

    Find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

      - Assign every node a tentative cost of infinity, except the start

      - Repeatedly pick the unvisited node with the lowest known cost,
        then update the costs of its neighbours if a cheaper route is found
        through the current node.
      - Track each node's 'parent' — the node we came from on the cheapest
        route — so we can reconstruct the path at the end.
